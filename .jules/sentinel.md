## 2026-06-19 - Added Content Security Policy
**Vulnerability:** Missing Content Security Policy (CSP) header.
**Learning:** Static HTML sites often neglect CSP, leaving them exposed to XSS or data injection if they later add dynamic content or if third-party scripts are compromised.
**Prevention:** Always include a strict baseline CSP (`default-src 'self'`) in `index.html` for static sites to establish defense-in-depth from the start.
## 2024-10-24 - Fix prototype pollution risk in i18n language parsing
**Vulnerability:** Unvalidated user input from `location.search` was used directly as an object key (`messages[query]`). This allowed an attacker to supply `?lang=__proto__` or `?lang=valueOf`, resulting in `messages[query]` returning built-in objects or functions rather than the intended language strings.
**Learning:** Checking for truthiness like `messages[query] ? query : ...` fails securely when dealing with inherited Object properties. Without a whitelist, user input accessing un-prototyped object keys is dangerous.
**Prevention:** Always validate external input against a strict whitelist (e.g. `['ko', 'en'].includes(query)`) before using it in application logic, or ensure dictionaries are created without prototypes (`Object.create(null)`).
